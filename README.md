# Financial-News-Analyzer
The idea behind this project is that there are plenty informations outside that the market struggles to incorporate into prices.
We have mjltiple examples in the literature of news that got slowly incorporated into prices, and the explanation to this is most of the times a Behavioural one.
The idea of this project is to feed a machine with data and try to see if we are able to extract useful informations out. The core idea is to use web scraping to gather sentiment and possible insights out of popular financial news services, that may lead to some sort of predictability of returs.
